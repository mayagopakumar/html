	<p>In an interim measure following an appeal by X Corp – previously Twitter Inc – the Karnataka High Court has allowed the deposit of only half the cost of Rs 50 lakh that was imposed by a single judge of the court on the firm on June 30 in a plea against the Government of India’s blocking orders on some Twitter accounts.</p>
	<p>In June this year, a single-judge bench of the Karnataka High Court dismissed a plea filed by Twitter Inc against orders issued by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology over the blocking of selective accounts, and imposed a cost of Rs 50 lakh since the social media company approached the court without complying with the orders for over a year.</p>
	<p>Twitter Inc, which has now become X Corp under the new ownership of US billionaire Elon Musk, appealed to a division bench of the Karnataka High Court against the June 30 order. It said the writ petition before the single judge was with respect to only 39 blocking orders issued by the government, and that the majority of the other orders were complied with.</p>
