	<p>Russian ports and ships on the Black Sea — including tankers carrying millions of barrels of oil to Europe — could justifiably be attacked by the Ukrainian military as part of efforts to weaken Moscow's war machine, a senior Kyiv official warned Monday in the wake of two recent attacks on Russian vessels.</p>
    <p><q>Everything the Russians are moving back and forth on the Black Sea are our valid military targets, <q> Oleg Ustenko, an economic adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told POLITICO, saying the move was retaliation for Russia withdrawing from the U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal and unleashing a series of missile attacks on agricultural stores and ports.</q>
    <p><q>This story started with Russia blocking the grain corridor, threatening to attack our vessels, destroying our ports,</q> Ustenko said.<q>Our maritime infrastructure is under constant attack.</q></p>
